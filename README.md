# MachineTranslation


MT_subwords_tokenizer.ipynb trains BERT tokenizers

ML_tensorflow.ipynb uses basic RNN, GRU, LSTM models and a small german <-> english dataset

translation.ipynb is a prebuilt huggingface transformer model that can be fine tuned

MT.eng-deu.transformer.ipynb is a german implementation of the Tensorflow example code for transformers

MT.eng-deu.transformer.paper.ipynb is a german implementation of the Tensorflow example code for transformers using the dimensions and layers of the original paper

MT.eng-deu.transformer.custom.ipynb is a german implementation of the Tensorflow example code for transformers using 512-dimension and 16 layers 16 heads

The 3 transformer notebooks require the tokenizer trained by the MT_subwords_tokenizer to run, that is in paracrawl_de_en_converter.zip
